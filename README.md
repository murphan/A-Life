2022 OSU Capstone Project

Depends on the Websocketpp library. Get it from this link: https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp/releases/tag/0.8.2

To set up the build, create a `UserBuild.txt` file in the project's directory and include the following line with the local path to the header files of Websocketpp:

> `SET(WEBSOCKETPP_DIR "C:/{{PATH TO WEBSOCKET LIBRARY}}/websocketpp-0.8.2/websocketpp")`
